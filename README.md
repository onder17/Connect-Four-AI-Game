<br/>

### ⚔️ Rules of War
Your objective is to align **4** of your colored pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the battlefield. *Remember, whoever controls the center column is always one step closer to victory.*

### 🧠 The AI Warrior
You are not facing an ordinary opponent. Your enemy is a flawless intelligence, empowered by the **Minimax Algorithm** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** tactics, capable of calculating your every move **5 steps ahead**. To defeat it, you will need deep strategy, not just luck.

### 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure
This battle simulation was forged using **Python**, **Pygame**, and **NumPy** libraries.
